## Definition
- A software architect's knowledge base needs to be constantly expanded in the modern environment of rapidly evolving technological dynamics.
> T-shaped skills: The vertical bar on the letter T represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own. [Wikipedia definiton of a T-shaped skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills)
- Applying the above concept of T-shaped skills to a software architect, you can focus on certain areas of technology (such as frontend, backend or full-stack up to certain extent) as a specialist but need to have a broader understanding other technology spectrum.
