## Definition
- A software architect's knowledge base needs to be constantly expanded in the modern environment of rapidly evolving technological dynamics.
> T-shaped skills: The vertical bar on the letter T represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own. [Wikipedia definiton of a T-shaped skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills)
- Applying the above concept of T-shaped skills to a software architect, you can focus on certain areas of technology (such as frontend, backend or full-stack up to certain extent) as a specialist but need to have a broader understanding other technology spectrum.

# Specialization Areas (The T-knowledge Vertical Bar)
- Specialization in Java/Python/Golang/JavaScript or any other programming language
- Specialization in web programming, data engineering, machine learning, or other subject areas
- You can choose from the below broader knowledge areas and make one or more as your specialization.

## Knowledge Level
You can broadly classify your knowledge level into 4 different buckets:
- Expert Knowledge: Classify a technology in this area when you are hands-on for more than 3+ years and have in-depth knowledge.
- Experimental Knowledge: Classify a technology in this area when you are hands-on for more than 1+ years and have basic knowledge.
- Know-how: Classify a technology in this area when you are understand the technology and used it on need basis.
- Want-to Experiment: Classify a technology in this area when you want to aspire to learn it in near future.

# Broader Knowledge Areas (The T-knowledge Horizontal Bar)
- The intention is not to enlist every technology and keeping it to 3-7 (currently pupular) in each area.
- Note that this is a community-driven decision and based on observations from the group of people. There is no statistical data available to support this.
